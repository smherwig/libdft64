Build instructions: 
Download and untar Intel Pin. I've been working with version 3.2
(https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/downloads/pin-3.2-81205-gcc-linux.tar.gz),
on linux, but more recent versions will probably also work. The
executable pin is in the root directory. There are sample tools in
source/tools/ that you can build by running make from that dir, but
it's not necessary to use pin. 

cd into the libdft_64 directory run make
PIN_ROOT=/path/to/pin_root_dir

This will create a directory called obj-intel64 if it doesn't exist
and write the build objects to it. Pintools are built as shared
objects, which are passed to pin as command line arguments.

The file makefile reads config info from makefile.rules then calls the
makefile in the Pin directory  To add/modify the build, the file to
change is makefile.rules. The tools to build are defined by
TOOL_ROOTS. To add another tool, you need to add rules on how to build
it (there are examples in the file).

To run a pintool: ~/path/to/pin_executable -t /path/to/pintool --
path/to/application If the application is multithreaded, use
'-follow-execv' to have Pin instrument all forked children.
